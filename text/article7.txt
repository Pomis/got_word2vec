House Stark of Winterfell is one of the Great Houses of Westeros and the principal noble house of the north. In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of the North and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. Their seat, Winterfell, is an ancient castle renowned for its strength.

Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white. Their words are "Winter is Coming", one of only a few house mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast.[1] Several of the POV characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are members of House Stark.

Aside from the Karstarks of Karhold, the Starks of Winterfell may have other, distant relatives in the north. White Harbor and Barrowton are considered to be likely options.[2] Some younger Starks have also held vassal holdfasts for the lords of Winterfell.[3]

The Starks have a reputation for long faces, brown hair, and grey eyes. Some are known for melancholy[8] and iciness,[9] while others have a wildness sometimes called "wolf blood".[10][11][12]

In the current generation of Starks, several members (e.g., Arya and Bran Stark and Jon Snow) have the ability to enter the minds of their direwolf pets as wargs, giving them the ability to experience the senses of their direwolves[13] and to see through their eyes. The latter occurs most frequently when the children sleep,[14][15] although they are able to do it at will when awake, once they are more practiced.[16][15]

Customs
House Stark traditionally buries deceased members of their family in the crypts below Winterfell.[17][18] The Kings of Winter and Lords of Winterfell are given a statue of their likeness, sitting by their tomb, whereas other family members normally do not get one.[19] Exceptions include Brandon and Lyanna Stark, who were given statues by their brother, Lord Eddard Stark,[19] and Artos Stark. The statues of the kings and lords have stone wolves by their feet[20][18] and have swords placed upon their lap,[18] which are said to keep the spirits of the dead at rest, locked within their tombs.[21][17]

House Stark traditionally follows the old gods. Following the marriage of Eddard to Lady Catelyn Tully, a follower of the Faith of the Seven, a small sept was constructed at Winterfell.[26]

The Starks have traditionally been friends of the Night's Watch.[19] The four youngest men to have served as Lord Commander, including Osric Stark, were brothers, sons, or bastards of Kings in the North.[27]

History
Kings in the North

The Starks are an ancient house of First Men descent.[1] House Stark was founded by Brandon the Builder, a legendary figure who lived during the Age of Heroes. Bran the Builder is said to have raised Winterfell, the seat of the Starks, and the Wall,[28] and other legends connect him with Storm's End[29] and the Hightower.[30] The Starks were Kings of Winter in the north for eight thousand years[31][32] since the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with Bran the Builder. The Night's King, the attainted thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has been suggested to have been a Stark, among other possibilities.[33] The Night's King is said to have been defeated by Brandon the Breaker and Joramun.[34]

The ancient Starks gradually defeated rival kings, such as the Barrow Kings to their south and the Red Kings to their east.[35] For several millennia, the Starks were not the uncontested Kings in the North. Their primary antagonists, the Red Kings from House Bolton of the Dreadfort, swore fealty some thousand years ago, ending their flaying ways. Meanwhile, King Jon Stark drove pirates from the White Knife, and the Wolf's Den was built at its mouth. This stronghold was often granted to sons and grandsons of the King in the North; one such branch, the Greystarks, was extinguished after allying with the Boltons against the Starks.[36] King Jon's son, Rickard, defeated the Marsh King and married his daughter, bringing the Neck into Winterfell's realm under the lordship of House Reed.[19]

When Andals attempted to conquer the north, King Theon Stark made common cause with House Bolton and defeated Argos Sevenstar in the Battle of the Weeping Water, after which he raised a fleet and sailed to Andalos. There he took revenge by sacking and putting hundreds to death. He later conquered the Three Sisters, and battled against the ironborn, driving them away from Cape Kraken and Bear Island and slaying Ravos Hoare. Both places were later taken back by King Loron Greyjoy, and King Rodrik Stark took Bear Island back after Loron's death. It is said that he did so by winning a wrestling match, though some scholars doubt the truth of this tale.[37][19] Rodrik's sons and grandsons took back Cape Kraken.[35] King Theon also smashed a rebellion in the Rills, and gave aid to the Night's Watch against wildlings.[35]

House Stark attempted to conquer the Three Sisters, which began a conflict between the Starks and House Arryn from the Vale. In response to the Rape of the Three Sisters, the Sistermen asked for help from Mathos II Arryn, King of Mountain and Vale. This conflict, the War Across the Water, lasted for a thousand years, during which time the Starks thrice landed on the Fingers.[38][39] During King Edric Stark's hundred-year long reign, the Wolf's Den, already torched by House Arryn, was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. Edric's great-grandson, King Brandon "Ice Eyes", took back the Wolf's Den.[36] After a thousand years of war, the Arryns were victorious over the Starks, and the Valemen have ruled over the Three Sisters ever since.[38]

Several centuries before Aegon's Conquest,[N 1] House Manderly was driven into exile from the Mander by Lord Lorimar Peake during the reign of Perceon III Gardener, King of the Reach.[35] The Starks welcomed them to the north, and accepted oaths of fealthy from the Manderlys, giving them the Wolf's Den and the surrounding lands, leading to the creation of White Harbor around the Wolf's Den.[40][35][41]

Possibly around 700 BC,[N 2] Karlon Stark, a younger son of Winterfell, helped crush a rebel lord. As a reward, he was granted lands on which he built a keep named Karl's Hold. Over time, the keep became known as Karhold and Karlon's descendants became House Karstark.[42]

King Brandon the Shipwright attempted to sail across the Sunset Sea, but never returned back home. His son, also named Brandon, burned the northern fleet in his grief.[19] The north has had no fleet since.[43]

The Starks helped repel several major wildling invasions, such as when they and their Umber bannermen defeated the brother Kings-Beyond-the-Wall Gendel and Gorne three thousand years ago.[44] Bael the Bard is said to have sired a son on the maiden daughter of Brandon the Daughterless. Bael was later slain by his own son, who was unaware of the fact that Bael was his father.[45]

Targaryen Dynasty

During Aegon's Conquest, King Torrhen Stark raised thirty thousand northmen and marched south. With the burning of Harrenhal and the Field of Fire in mind, however, Torrhen submitted without battle to Aegon I Targaryen.[46] Since the time of the King Who Knelt, the Starks have held the north for the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms as Wardens of the North.[47] Queen Rhaenys Targaryen arranged the marriage of Torrhen's daughter to Ronnel Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie, in an attempt to knit the new realm together.[48][49] There are letters at the Citadel which suggest that Torrhen only agreed to this match after much protest, and that his sons had refused to attend the wedding.[48] Torrhen's sons did not agree with the rule of House Targaryen. Some spoke of rebelling and raising the Stark banner,[48] but it is unknown whether a rebellion took place.

In 58 AC, Queen Alysanne Targaryen visited Winterfell and was received by Lord Alaric Stark. Lord Alaric's daughter Alarra grew particularly close to the queen during her visit.[50] During the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, Lord Stark[N 3] donated land, which was renamed the New Gift, to the Night's Watch. While in current times it is said that Lord Stark was glad to do so, he in truth had been forced to do so by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne. Lord Stark's brother sent letters to the Citadel, asking for precedents against forced donation of property. As such, it was said at the time that the Starks were bitter about having been forced to part with the land, and Maester Yandel believes that this might have been the reason why Lord Ellard Stark supported the claim of Laenor Velaryon over the claim of Prince Viserys Targaryen during the Great Council of 101 AC.[48]

In 129 AC, as the Dance of the Dragons began, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon recruited Lord Cregan Stark's aid for his mother, Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, known as the Pact of Ice and Fire,[48] even though the north was considered to be too remote to be of much influence in the war.[51] Cregan delayed giving aid, as he wished to have as many men as possible to harvest crops before winter came.[52] After winter had begun, Cregan led a great army of men, childless, homeless, unwed, or old men, and younger sons, to King's Landing. He arrived after King Aegon II Targaryen had been poisoned, however, and though he had hoped to punish those lords who had supported Aegon II, Lord Corlys Velaryon had already send out ravens suing for peace. While the court awaited replies, Cregan held sway and arrested all those involved in Aegon II's death. Young King Aegon III Targaryen was cowed into naming Cregan his Hand of the King, though Cregan served only a day in that office, a time known as the Hour of the Wolf. Lord Stark held trials for twenty-one out of twenty-two of his prisoners, with Corlys the only one spared a trial. Aegon III pardoned Lord Velaryon and restored his titles to him, which Cregan allowed when Aly Blackwood offered the Hand her own hand in marriage. Cregan returned north the next day.[53]

Cregan's heir, Rickon, fought in the conquest of Dorne during the reign of King Daeron I Targaryen. He died during one of the final battles outside of Sunspear.[48] Lord Barthogan Stark, Cregan's younger son, died in the Skagosi rebellion during the reign of Daeron II Targaryen.[54] Early in the reign of Aerys I, Lord Beron Stark, Cregan's grandson, gathered swords to battle Lord Dagon Greyjoy.[55] He became fatally injured in battle, and as he slowly succumed of his wounds, his wife and several recent Stark widows struggled over the succession, as there were multiple potential heirs.[56][57]

In 226 AC, Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, led a wildling invasion. Lord Willam Stark of Winterfell and Lord Harmond Umber of Last Hearth met the wildling host in battle on the shores of Long Lake. Although Willam was killed by Raymun, his younger brother, Artos, avenged him by slaying the King-Beyond-the-Wall.[58][44]

Robert's Rebellion

Eddard Stark by John Picacio ©
Lord Rickard Stark, urged on by his maester, Walys, allegedly sought to further southron alliances.[59] He sent his second son, Eddard, to be fostered with Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie at the age of eight. There, Eddard befriended fellow ward Robert Baratheon.[26][60] Rickard betrothed his heir, Brandon, to Catelyn Tully, the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun,[60] and his only daughter, Lyanna, to Robert, Lord of Storm's End.[8][61] Rickard's four children attended the tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, where they met Howland Reed. After winning the jousting competition at the tourney, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen crowned Lyanna as his queen of love and beauty, passing over his own wife, Princess Elia Martell.[62]

In 282 AC, Brandon Stark was at Riverrun when the date of his wedding to Catelyn Tully was announced. Petyr Baelish, Lord Hoster's ward, had been in love with Catelyn for years, and challenged Brandon to a duel for Catelyn's hand. Brandon won.[63][64][65][6] After the duel, Brandon left Riverrun, promising his bride-to-be that he would return soon.[6] On his way back to Riverrun, however, Brandon heard about Lyanna's abduction by Prince Rhaegar, and rode for King's Landing, where he was arrested by Aerys II for threatening the life of the crown prince. Rickard, who had been on his way to Riverrun with the wedding party, was summoned to court to answer for Brandon's crime. Brandon and Rickard were executed by Aerys II; Rickard was burned alive, while Brandon strangled himself in his attempt to rescue his father.[66][22][67] After the executions, King Aerys demanded the heads of Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon from their former foster father, Jon Arryn. The Lord of the Eyrie refused, however, and raised his banners in revolt.[26][68] This act is seen as the start of Robert's Rebellion.[68]

Eddard travelled made an arduous journey through the Vale of Arryn and the Bite to call his banners in the north.[39] The new lord then marched south and won an important victory during the Battle of the Bells, rescuing his friend Robert.[69] Next, he went to Riverrun, where he honored his late brother Brandon's betrothal by marrying Catelyn Tully as part of an alliance to bring House Tully into the rebel fold.[70][60] One of the principal commanders in the war, Ned took command of the rebel army after the Battle of the Trident, following the remnants of Rhaegar's army to King's Landing.

Ned arrived at the capital after the Sack of King's Landing by Lord Tywin Lannister, however, and Lord Stark found Aerys II dead and Ser Jaime Lannister sitting on the Iron Throne.[71] He had a falling out with Robert when Robert accepted the aid of House Lannister and condoned the murders of Rhaegar's wife, young daughter, and infant son. Eddard rode south the next day to relieve the siege of Storm's End.[71] Afterwards, Eddard and six companions went to retrieve Lyanna at the fortress Rhaegar had named the tower of joy.[72] They fought the three Kingsguard knights stationed there, who killed all but Eddard and Howland Reed.[72] Eddard found Lyanna dying in a bed of blood, clutching rose petals, dead and black, in her palm.[8] She forced him to make a promise to her, the contents of which are unknown, but which have haunted Eddard since. Eddard and Robert were reconciled in their shared grief over Lyanna's death.[71]

Eddard returned from the war with his bastard son, Jon Snow,[60] said to have been birthed by Wylla,[71] and Ned was presented with his trueborn son, Robb, by Catelyn when she arrived from Riverrun. Ned buried Lyanna's body in the crypt of Winterfell beside her father and brother.[8] Eddard's younger brother, Benjen, joined the Night's Watch within a few months of Eddard's return from the war.[73] A skilled ranger,[74] Benjen eventually became First Ranger.[75] Eddard fought in Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, and took Balon Greyjoy's son Theon with him to Winterfell, a hostage to ensure the loyalty of the Lord of the Iron Islands.[8] Eddard has ruled the north in Robert's name, keeping a distance from the intrigue-ridden politics of King's Landing.[76]

Following the death of his Hand of the King, Lord Jon Arryn, King Robert I Baratheon journeys to Winterfell to offer Lord Eddard Stark the office.[26][8] A letter arrives from Lysa Arryn, Jon's widow and Eddard's wife Catelyn's sister, who claims the Lannisters were behind Lord Arryn's sudden death. At Catelyn's urging, Ned grudgingly accepts the Handship and a betrothal of their daughter Sansa to Prince Joffrey Baratheon.[60] During the royal party's stay, Eddard's second son, Bran, accidentally witnesses Queen Cersei Lannister having sex with her twin brother, Ser Jaime.[76] Jaime throws Bran out of the tower window, hoping to kill him to keep their relationship a secret.[76] Bran survives, but is crippled and comatose.[77][78] Eddard rides to King's Landing along with his daughters, Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn remains at Winterfell with their sons. Meanwhile, Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow, rides north with his uncle, Benjen, to join the Night's Watch.[75] Catelyn is inconsolable in her worry for Bran, ignoring her duties as Lady of Winterfell, but she is jolted back to reality by an attempt on Bran's life thwarted only by his direwolf.[79] As Bran lies comatose, he begins to have visions of a three-eyed crow.[80]

Near the ruby ford and the crossroads, Arya defends her friend Mycah from the aggressions of Prince Joffrey Baratheon, upsetting Sansa.[5] This is exacerbated when Sansa's direwolf, Lady, is ordered dead in place of Arya's, Nymeria, which has escaped.[81]

In King's Landing, Eddard is outraged to find that the crown is heavily in debt (largely to Robert's goodfather, Lord Tywin Lannister) and that the king intends to throw a lavish tourney in his honor.[9] After taking up his duties as Hand, Eddard assigns twenty of his household guard to assist the gold cloaks in keeping order in King's Landing.[82]

Ned investigates the death of Jon Arryn, determining that he was looking into the king's bastard brood. When Robert holds a small council meeting to arrange the death of the exiled Daenerys Targaryen, who has wed Drogo, a mighty khal of the Dothraki, Ned refuses to condone the assassination and resigns as Hand.[83] In the streets of the capital, he is waylaid by Jaime Lannister and red cloaks in retaliation for Catelyn's abduction of Tyrion Lannister, whom her foster-brother, Petyr Baelish, had told her was responsible for the attempt on Bran's life.[84] Ned's leg is broken and his best men slain, but Ned survives and Robert re-confirms his appointment as Hand before going on a hunt and leaving Ned to sit the Iron Throne.[72] In this capacity he sends men, including twenty Stark guards, to stop Ser Gregor Clegane from raiding the riverlands.[85] Gregor's attacks were ordered by Lord Lannister; since Lord Stark was wounded he was not lured into the field and thus could not be captured and traded for Tyrion. The men sent after Gregor are ambushed and many are slain.[86] Catelyn brings Tyrion to her sister Lysa at the Eyrie, but Tyrion is released after Bronn is victorious in a trial by battle.[6]

On the Wall, Jon Snow deals with the cruel tutelage of Ser Alliser Thorne while making friends such as Samwell Tarly and learning lessons from his elders.[87] Jon becomes the personal steward of Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.[88] The youth encounters a hint of the evil that supposedly lies beyond the Wall when the corpses of two of his uncle's men rise from the dead and go on the rampage at Castle Black; Jon saves the Lord Commander from being killed by one of the wights.[89]

Eventually, Ned arrives at the same conclusion at which Jon Arryn did: that Queen Cersei's children are not Robert's, but bastards born of incest between the Lannister twins, and determines that it is this secret for which Jon was murdered. He approaches Cersei with this truth, warning her to flee the city.[90] Enlisting Lord Baelish to recruit the gold cloaks,[91] Ned confronts Cersei after Robert's death from a hunting accident, insisting that Stannis Baratheon is now king by rights. Littlefinger betrays Ned, however, and the Hand's men are slaughtered by Janos Slynt's gold cloaks and Ned is thrown into a black cell.[92] Sansa is held hostage in the Red Keep,[93] but Arya manages to escape thanks to Syrio Forel, the fencing master Ned had hired to train her in swordplay.[18]

Robb Stark, upon hearing this news, calls the banners of Winterfell and marches south to rescue his father and sisters.[22] Catelyn arranges an alliance with Lord Walder Frey to negotiate a crossing of the Green Fork, promising that Robb and Arya will wed Freys.[94] Robb captures Jaime in the Whispering Wood[95] and then relieves the Lannisters' siege of Riverrun with the Battle of the Camps.[96] The rest of the Stark army, led by Lord Roose Bolton, is defeated by Tywin in the battle on the Green Fork, however.[97]

Ned initially refuses to name Joffrey as the true king, but in the end agrees in order to ensure the safety of Sansa.[62] When he publicly announces this support at the Great Sept of Baelor, however, the capricious boy king orders Ned's execution rather than allow him to join the Night's Watch as planned.[98] In response, the northern and river lords at Robb's war council in Riverrun proclaim him King in the North, seceding from the realm of the Iron Throne.[99]

Benjen has gone missing beyond the Wall, and Jon Snow, after briefly deserting the Watch to join his half-brother's army, rides as part of the great ranging meant to determine his fate and the threats of the Others and wildlings.[24]

Robb, King in the North and King of the Trident, invades the westerlands, winning a string of victories against Lannister bannermen.[20][100] In an effort to gain allies, he sends his father's ward, Theon Greyjoy, and his mother, Catelyn, as envoys to Balon Greyjoy and Renly Baratheon, respectively. However, Theon joins his family, House Greyjoy, in attacking the north,[101] while Catelyn's diplomatic progress is shattered when Renly is killed by Melisandre's shadow assassin.[102] Renly's sworn shield, Brienne of Tarth, takes up service with Catelyn.[100] While Riverrun celebrates the Battle of the Fords, Robb is reported to have taken the Crag.[103]

Arya journeys north with Yoren and his new recruits for the Night's Watch, including King Robert's bastard Gendry,[104] but their band is attacked by westermen at a Gods Eye town[79] and she is eventually taken into captivity by the Mountain's men.[105] At Harrenhal, she is witness to myriad atrocities, but remains strong, orchestrating several deaths of her tormentors via the assassin Jaqen H'ghar.[106] During the fall of Harrenhal to Roose Bolton, Arya helps free a band of northern prisoners.[107] The incognito Arya is named Roose's cupbearer, but she does not trust her father's bannerman and flees the castle when Roose intends to give it to Vargo Hoat.[12] Meanwhile, Sansa remains in custody at the Red Keep, betrothed to King Joffrey. She suffers abuse at his hands,[108] but makes tenuous relationships with Sandor Clegane,[32] Dontos Hollard,[109] and Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King.[108]

At Winterfell, Bran enjoys titular reign and hosts two Frey wards, Big Walder and Little Walder.[11] Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik Cassel deal with such issues as the harvest feast, the Hornwood inheritance, and the atrocities of Ramsay Snow, the Bastard of Bolton.[43][20] With the guidance of the Reed children, Jojen and Meera, Bran hones his gift for greensight and skinchanging.[110] When Rodrik leads six hundred Winterfell men, among others, to battle the ironborn under Dagmer Cleftjaw, Theon Greyjoy seizes Winterfell.[111] On his return to Winterfell, Rodrik and his men mean to liberate the castle from Theon, but are betrayed and routed by Ramsay. Luwin and Rodrik are mortally wounded by Ramsay's men, and Theon is captured during the sack of Winterfell.[112] Bran and Rickon, thought to have been killed by Theon, leave the crypts of Winterfell after the Boltons depart. The Starks boys split up and flee towards remote northern havens.[17]

Benjen remains lost beyond the Wall. Jon Snow joins Qhorin Halfhand on a scouting mission in the Skirling Pass, during which he refuses an order to execute a spearwife named Ygritte.[45] On their return to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, the pair encounter a wildling band led by Rattleshirt. Jon, on orders from Qhorin, joins the wildlings as a double agent, and is forced to kill the Halfhand to prove his earnestness. Ygritte, now with Rattleshirt, vouches for Jon.[113]

A Storm of Swords

With Stannis Baratheon's power broken by the Battle of the Blackwater and the Tyrells and Martells allied with the Lannisters, the Stark-Tully forces stand alone against their foes in the south, and the Greyjoys threaten the north.[114] Ramsay blames the slaughter at Winterfell on Theon and his ironborn.[115]

Having been informed of Bran's and Rickon's alleged deaths, Catelyn frees Jaime Lannister in a desperate attempt to trade him for her daughters, sending Brienne to accompany him to King's Landing. Catelyn is put under house arrest at Riverrun.[70] Meanwhile, Robb returns from his westerlands campaign having wed Jeyne Westerling, the daughter of a minor Lannister bannerman. Jeyne had treated Robb's wounds after the storming of the Crag, and the youths slept together after Robb was informed of the deaths of his brothers. This marriage breaks the Starks' alliance with the furious Freys, however.[70][114] With Jaime gone from Riverrun, the vengeful Lord Rickard Karstark murders two prisoners, Willem Lannister and Tion Frey. Rickard is in turn executed by Robb, alienating House Karstark.[42]

Lord Walder Frey accepts Robb's offer to forgive his breach of marriage contract by having Robb's uncle, Edmure Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, stand in the king's place.[115] Robb and Catelyn ride with thirty-five hundred veterans to attend the wedding at the Twins.[116] At Hag's Mire Robb designates his heir (believed to be Jon Snow,[117] in spite of the Night's Watch vows) and resolves to march north to reclaim his homeland from the Greyjoys.[116] Meanwhile, Arya traverses the riverlands, unknowingly entering the mind of her lost direwolf, Nymeria, and killing several sellswords of the Brave Companions chasing her from Harrenhal.[118] She joins with the brotherhood without banners, whose founding members included the Winterfell guards Alyn and Harwin.[119] However, Arya is abducted by the Hound, Sandor Clegane, who hopes to ransom her at Edmure's wedding.[120]

In preparation for the siege of Moat Cailin, Robb's host reconvenes with Lord Roose Bolton's thirty-five hundred men at the Twins. Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King to Joffrey I Baratheon, has been conspiring with Roose and Walder, however. Despite guest right, Robb, Catelyn, and many of their bannermen are murdered or taken captive in the Red Wedding.[121]

Bran journeys north with Hodor, Jojen and Meera Reed, and his direwolf Summer.[122][123] They pass through the Wall at the Nightfort with the aid of Samwell Tarly and Coldhands.[33]

Further north, Jon Snow ingratiates himself with the free folk, beginning a romance with Ygritte and befriending Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall, and other wildling leaders.[124] He scales the Wall with Styr, the Magnar of Thenn,[125] and escapes from Queenscrown[126] to Castle Black in time to help prepare for the assault of the wildlings.[127] Ygritte and Styr are killed during the fighting,[128] and command over the black brothers falls to Jon after the death of Donal Noye.[129] Jon successfully defends the Wall during the early stages of the battle beneath the Wall, until Ser Alliser Thorne and Lord Janos Slynt arrive and imprison him for allegedly betraying his vows.[130] They send him to assassinate Mance under a flag of parley, but Stannis Baratheon's arrival breaks the wildling host before the deed is carried out.[131] After the battle, Stannis offers to legitimize the youth as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.[132] Jon decides to decline the offer, however, and is then elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch thanks to the maneuverings of his friend, Samwell Tarly.[133][13]

The Hound brings Arya toward the Eyrie in an attempt to ransom her to her aunt, Lady Lysa Arryn, but they are halted by snow in the Mountains of the Moon.[134] They are attacked by the Mountain's men at the crossroads inn and Sandor is stabbed. Arya leaves the Hound to die along the Trident. At Saltpans she uses the iron coin given to her by Jaqen H'ghar to book passage across the narrow sea on the galleas Titan's Daughter.[135]

Sansa's engagement to King Joffrey is ended by his betrothal to Margaery Tyrell. She begins to mingle with the Tyrell women in King's Landing and is nearly betrothed to Willas Tyrell.[136] She is abruptly wed to Tyrion Lannister instead, but they never consummate their match.[137] The pair are blamed for Joffrey's murder at his wedding feast; in truth it was orchestrated by Petyr Baelish and Olenna Tyrell.[138] Petyr smuggles Sansa out of the capital, murdering his pawn and her friend, Dontos Hollard.[139] He brings Sansa to the Fingers, where he marries her aunt, Lysa,[138] and then to the Eyrie.[140] Littlefinger keeps Sansa hidden by presenting her as his natural daughter, Alayne Stone. Lysa observes Petyr kiss Sansa after the girl builds a snow castle of Winterfell. When Lysa drunkenly accuses Sansa of trying to steal her new husband and reveals that she and Petyr had killed her first husband, Lord Jon Arryn, Littlefinger throws Lysa from the Moon Door.[140]

With Bran and Rickon thought dead and Sansa and Arya missing, House Stark is all but extinguished in the eyes of the world. The Iron Throne names Roose Bolton as Warden of the North and legitimizes his son Ramsay, and most rivermen return to the king's peace.[141][142] Ice, the ancestral Valyrian steel blade of the Starks, has been reforged into two new Lannister blades, Widow's Wail[143] and Oathkeeper.[142] A revived Catelyn Stark takes leadership of the brotherhood and hangs Freys.[144]

Sansa remains in the Vale of Arryn, where she takes on a maternal role for her young cousin, Lord Robert Arryn, and she presents herself as Alayne to Nestor Royce[148] and the Lords Declarant.[149] Littlefinger plots to reveal her identity, wed her to Robert's heir, Ser Harrold Hardyng, and use the knights of the Vale to retake the north in her name.[149][150]

Arya arrives in Braavos, where she takes up training at the House of Black and White to become a Faceless Man.[151]

Soldiers bearing the colors of House Stark have washed up on the shores of the Quiet Isle. According to the Elder Brother, they are buried alongside their enemies.[152] Brienne of Tarth, tasked by Jaime with finding Sansa, use Oathkeeper in her journeys through the crownlands and riverlands.[153][154] She is captured by the brotherhood, however, and brought to Lady Stoneheart, Catelyn.[155]

A Dance with Dragons
Lord Commander Jon Snow begins an uneasy alliance with the free folk, executes the recalcitrant Janos Slynt, and tactfully deals with the imperious Stannis Baratheon. While refusing the king's offer to be legitimized as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and wed the "wildling princess", Val, Jon offers Stannis advice that helps him in his campaign against the Boltons and Greyjoys.

At Winterfell, Sansa's friend Jeyne Poole is wed to Ramsay Bolton in the guise of "Arya Stark" in an effort to legitimize Bolton overlordship, with Ramsay claiming to be Lord of Winterfell.[59] A disguised Mance Rayder, sent by Jon Snow, recruits a broken-willed Theon Greyjoy to rescue the girl and deliver her to Stannis.[156] When Jon gives orders to retake Winterfell from Ramsay after receiving an inflammatory letter, the senior officers of the Watch turn on Jon in the mutiny at Castle Black for allying with wildlings and meddling in the affairs of the realm.[157]

Bran arrives at the cave of the three-eyed crow, where he meets the last greenseer and children of the forest and begins perfecting the advanced arts of greensight.[158] Rickon, Osha, and Shaggydog are said to be on Skagos, where Lord Wyman Manderly has requested that Davos Seaworth search for Rickon, so that Stannis can rally the northmen to fight in his name.[36]

Historical Members
No precise lineage of House Stark is known before approximately 100 AC, but the individuals listed below are supposed to be in rough chronological order.

Kings of Winter/Kings in the North
The following is a possible chronology of known Kings in the North; no precise lineage is known and some published information may be contradictory.

Antiquity
Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Builder, founder of House Stark and the first King in the North, alleged builder of Winterfell,[26] Storm's End,[159] the Hightower,[30] and the Wall.[28]
Brandon Stark, his son. According to some he was the one who was commissioned to build the Hightower by King Uthor of the High Tower instead of his father.[30]
Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Breaker, who allied with Joramun to defeat the Night's King.[34]
Wolf's Den
Jon Stark, who built the Wolf's Den after driving sea raiders—possibly Ibbenese, Valyrians, or early Andals[35]—away from the White Knife.[19][36]
Rickard Stark, also known as the Laughing Wolf, son of Jon, who defeated the Marsh King and extended the Stark kingdom to include the Neck.[19][160]
Theon Stark, also known as the Hungry Wolf, who defeated the greatest Andal invader, Argos Sevenstar, conquered the Three Sisters, and attacked the Fingers,[35] possibly beginning the War Across the Water.
Edrick Stark, also known as Edrick Snowbeard, who ruled for near a century but lost the Wolf's Den to slavers from the Stepstones.[36]
Brandon Stark, also known as Ice Eyes, Edrick's great-grandson, who recovered the Wolf's Den from slavers.[36]
Centuries before the Conquest
Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Shipwright, who loved to sail and built up a mighty northern fleet.[19]
Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Burner, who burned the entire northern fleet after the disappearance of his father, Brandon the Shipwright, on the Sunset Sea.[19] The north has since had no strength at sea for centuries.[43]
Karlon Stark, a younger son of a King of Winter, who would become the founder of House Karstark.[42]
Harlon Stark, who centuries ago starved out the Dreadfort in a siege lasting two years.[161]
Torrhen Stark, also known as the King Who Knelt, who bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, making the north part of the Seven Kingdoms subject to the Iron Throne.[19]
Uncertain era
Dorren Stark, who reigned when Redwyn fought giants and traded with children of the forest.[162]
Brandon IX Stark, who destroyed the ships of the Skagosi.[54]
Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island from the ironborn in a wrestling match and awarded it to House Mormont.[19] This occurred after the death of the Old Kraken, Loron Greyjoy,[35] a High King of the Iron Islands chosen in a kingsmoot.[163] Rodrik's sons and grandsons battled the ironborn over Cape Kraken.[35]
Benjen Stark, also known as Benjen the Bitter.[112]
Benjen Stark, also known as Benjen the Sweet.[112]

Possible members
Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Daughterless.[45]
His daughter.[45]
Her son by Bael the Bard.[45]
Brandon the Daughterless, his daughter, and his grandson are mentioned in the wildling legend of Bael the Bard,[45] but the story is not mentioned in historical records [44] and Beal's entire existence, and thus that of the Starks mentioned in the story is doubted by some, like Maester Yandel.[44] Jon Snow, upon hearing the story from Ygritte, thinks Bael to be a liar and calls the story false, having never heard it before.[45]

Crypts
Traveling in the crypt of Winterfell in Chapter 66 of A Game of Thrones, Bran Stark sees the statues of Kings Jon, Rickard, Theon, Brandon the Shipwright, Brandon the Burner, Rodrik, and Torrhen.[19] It is unconfirmed if this is a chronological listing.

While leaving the crypt in Chapter 69 of A Clash of Kings, Bran sees the statues of Kings Torrhen, Edwyn, Theon, Brandon the Burner, Brandon the Shipwright, Jorah, Jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton, Edderion, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet, Benjen the Bitter, and Edrick.[17] It is unconfirmed if this is a reverse chronological listing.
